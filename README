===========================
===  What is HiC-Pro ?  ===
===========================

HiC-Pro was designed to process Hi-C data, from raw fastq files (paired-end Illumina data) to the normalized contact maps. The pipeline is flexible, scalable and optimized. It can operate either on a single laptop or on a computational cluster using the PBS-Torque scheduler

If you use HiC-Pro, please cite :

===========================
=== How to install it ? ===
===========================

The HiC-Pro pipeline requires the following dependencies :
- The bowtie2 mapper (or any other mapper)
- Python with pysam, bx, numpy, and scipy libraries
- R with the RColorBrewer and ggplot2 packages
- g++ compiler
- Samtools (>0.1.18)

To install HiC-Pro

> tar -zxvf HiC-Pro.2.3.1.tar.gz
> cd HiC-Pro_2.3.1
> make install

Note that if some of these dependencies are not installed (i.e. not detected in the $PATH), HiC-Pro will try to install them. You can also edit the config-install.txt file and manually defined the paths to dependencies.

===========================
=== How to use it ? ===
===========================

1- Copy and edit the configuration file 'config-hicpro.txt' in your local folder

2- Put all fastq files in a rawdata folder. Each fastq file has to be put in a folder per sample.

3- Run HiC-Pro

I. Without PBS-Torque 
MY_INSTALL_PATH/bin/HiC-Pro -i FULL_PATH_TO_RAW_DATA -o FULL_PATH_TO_OUTPUTS -c MY_LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE

II. With PBS-Torque
MY_INSTALL_PATH/bin/HiC-Pro -i FULL_PATH_TO_RAW_DATA -o FULL_PATH_TO_OUTPUTS -c MY_LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE -p

You will get the following message :
Please run HiC-Pro in two steps :
1- The following command will launch the parallel workflow through 12 torque jobs:
qsub HiCPro_step1.sh
2- The second command will merge all outputs to generate the contact maps:
qsub HiCPro_step2.sh

Execute the displayed command:
qsub HiCPro_step1.sh
774410[].torque.curie.fr

Then wait for the torque mails... :)
Once executed succesfully (may take several hours), then type:
qsub HiCPro_step2.sh
