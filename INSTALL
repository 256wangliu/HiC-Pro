## HiC-Pro Installation 
##
#############################

The HiC-Pro pipeline will be compiled and installed in the current directory.
All dependencies will be checked during installation, and installed if possible.
The installation process will generate a config-system.txt file which defines all paths to HiC-Pro dependencies. Please, do not edit this file !

##

Dependencies are checked during installation.
A couple of tools such as bowtie2 and samtools (>1.0) can be automatically installed if not detected.
Others have to be installed before starting the installation :

--- bx-python - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bx-python
